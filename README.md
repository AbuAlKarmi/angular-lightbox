# Angular Lightbox

Made this little snippet to generate a simple lightbox on Angular, basic support
for iframes and separated directive to close it from whichever element you wish.

Needs some optimization and fixing some things I don't like including code style.

No styling included! you need to provide your own styling.

Use as you wish.
